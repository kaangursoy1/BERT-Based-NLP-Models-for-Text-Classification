# BERT-Based-NLP-Models-for-Text-Classification
# Overview
This project leverages BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a state-of-the-art NLP model, for text classification. The model is fine-tuned on the Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA) from the GLUE benchmark, focusing on achieving high performance through hyperparameter optimization.

# Features
Fine-tuning BERT and its Variants: Utilizes BERT for sequence classification with pre-trained models, fine-tuned to improve text classification accuracy.
Custom Hyperparameter Optimization: Implements hyperparameter tuning using Optuna to investigate the effects of:
Learning Rate
Number of Epochs
Maximum Input Sequence Length
Dropout Rate at the Classification Head
Advanced Metrics for Evaluation: The model performance is evaluated using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), ensuring robust evaluation metrics for text classification.
Alternative Architectures: Explores additional architectures beyond the [CLS] token approach for document representation to compare different BERT-based classification strategies.
# Results
The best-performing model achieved competitive results on the CoLA dataset, validated through MCC and loss metrics. Detailed visualizations of training curves, as well as comparisons of hyperparameter impacts, are available in the results section.

# Conclusions
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of fine-tuning BERT for NLP tasks and highlights the importance of hyperparameter tuning. Further exploration of alternate architectures reveals potential for performance improvements in specific text classification scenarios.
